# Aspirations, Values and Principles

This document describes the highest aspirations, the values we use to achieve them, and our foundational principles. It is a living document - it is always open for discussion and change.

## We Make Great Things
* Valuable - deliver solutions that are considered important and useful
* Pragmatic - priority given to practical rather than theoretical value
* Innovative - incorporate new ideas and methods
* Creative - deliver surprising and delightful solutions

## With Great People
* Passionate - enthusiastic about what we do, and how we do it.
* Moral - a path of 'right conduct' when known, will be followed. When unknown will be discussed until we have a path that works.
* Honest - honesty, and the resulting trust, is the cornerstone of successful work relationships
* Engaged - connected to the work and results
* Curious - lifelong learner
* Open / Collaborative - highly effective team worker

## With an Amazing Culture
* We are assertive - part of being passionate and engaged, we assertive when it comes to getting ideas across
* We work as a Team - the most valuable, innovative and creative solutions come from amazing teamwork
* We invest in people - to solve hard problems, people need time to study and explore
* We solve real problems
	* while theory informs, practical solutions feed us
	* This sometimes means leaving money on the table or even walking away from business opportunities
* We spend project money like it's our own - we recognize the value of currency; ours and our customers
* We find the sustainable value in all that we do - sustainable value requires an edge; we must be able to articulate one and have material skills to make a dent
* We start and end with the customer / end user - self-evident for us
* We are people not resources - people make mistakes; have high and low points; lives outside of work; we are not machines and we work with the constraints that people need
* Fail fast; adjust; adapt (we embrace our ignorance) - true learning requires drawing lessons from unexpected outcomes (some call this failure)
* Lean experiments - getting to the root requires rapidly testing hypothesis, recording the results, adjusting and then moving forward
